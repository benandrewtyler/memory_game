## Overview

This readme is to give instruction on how to play the Memory game, list the files used in creating my Memory game, credit contributers, list useful resources and share future planned developments.
The project started with an initial template provided by Udacity consisting of a flat file UI and a card shuffle function [Udacity git repo](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) 
Below is an overview of what is in scope of this project and the linked manual and what is not:

## Instructions

Concentration, also known as Memory, is a great family card game. It's easy to make the game easier or more difficult, and younger players tend to be able to compete with older players because they generally excel at memory-based games.


### Players
1 player.

### Deck
16 card deck consisting of 8 different pairs of symbols.

### Goal
To match all pairs of cards.

### Gameplay
On each turn, the player turns over two cards (one at a time) they stay turned over if they match symbols, if not, they turn back face down. The player then takes another turn.

### Scoring
A timer is started from the first card turn and the total time is logged when you match all of the pairs. Compete with yourself by trying to get a faster time in a second game. You also lose stars for more turns taken, between 16 and 24 you lose 1 star (bringing you down to 2), over 24 you lose another. your turn count is also tracked

### Winning
When all the pairs have been found.

## Useful resources

In the following links you will find resources that i utilised whilst building the memory game:
* [W3C's index of HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/)
* [W3School's JS tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
* [Udacity git repo](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game)
* [MDN's javascript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript)

Any suggestions of additional resources that would be useful to the community
would be warmly welcome and greatly appreciated.
Feel free to add your suggestions by creating a new pull request
with the component "Documentation" with your
comment.

## Troubleshooting

TBC

## Future developments

I will be adding a link to my Kanban board for future updates to this and other projects, but before this, below is a short list of nice to haves in the short term:

* Updated UI - I would like to add card flip animation and make the colour scheme a little more personal
* Winning - Make the act of winning have an incentive
* Start page - Add a start menu

Lastly, efforts could be made and hopefully sustained on the overall
maintenance, with improved documentation, tutorials/presentations of how
features could be leveraged or extended and of course the usual bug fixes.

## Contributions

Feel free to follow up in the issue queue for any contributions, bug
reports, feature requests.
Tests, feedback or comments in general are highly appreciated.

For details, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Credits

We are particularly grateful to the Udacity community behind the creation of the FEND course, their authors and all their contributors for their great work from which this memory game was greatly inspired and without which perhaps i would not be the front end dev I am today.
Hopefully, new features, patches or tests added to this repo might as well be ported/adapted to be contributed and shared back in return.
