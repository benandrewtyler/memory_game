## Overview

This readme is to give instruction on how to play the Memory game, list the files used in creating my Memory game, credit contributers, list useful resources and share future planned developments.
The project started with an initial template provided by Udacity consisting of a flat file UI and a card shuffle function [Udacity git repo](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) 
Below is an overview of what is in scope of this project and the linked manual and what is not:

## Instructions

Concentration, also known as Memory, is a great family card game. It's easy to make the game easier or more difficult, and younger players tend to be able to compete with older players because they generally excel at memory-based games.


### Players
1 player.

# Deck
16 card deck consisting of 8 different pairs of symbols.

# Goal
To match all pairs of cards.

* Gameplay
On each turn, the player turns over two cards (one at a time) they stay turned over if they match symbols, if not, they turn back face down. The player then takes another turn.

* Scoring
A timer is started from the first card turn and the total time is logged when you match all of the pairs. Compete with yourself by trying to get a faster time in a second game. You also lose stars for more turns taken, between 16 and 24 you lose 1 star (bringing you down to 2), over 24 you lose another. your turn count is also tracked

* Winning
When all the pairs have been found.
